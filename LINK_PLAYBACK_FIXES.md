# AudioBook Player - Link Playback Fixes

## Issues Identified

The player couldn't play streaming links due to several Android MediaPlayer compatibility issues:

1. **MediaPlayer URL Handling**: Android MediaPlayer is sensitive to how HTTP URLs are set
2. **Network Security**: HTTPS certificate validation and network security config
3. **Error Handling**: Auto-skipping chapters on errors instead of proper retry logic
4. **Range Request Support**: Backend wasn't properly handling HTTP range requests

## Fixes Applied

### 1. MediaPlayer URL Configuration
**File**: `AudiobookPlayer/app/src/main/java/com/audiobookplayer/services/MediaPlaybackService.kt`

- Changed from URI-based `setDataSource()` to string-based for HTTP URLs
- Removed custom headers that could cause compatibility issues
- Added proper error callbacks and retry logic

```kotlin
// Before: Complex URI approach with headers
setDataSource(context, Uri.parse(url), headers)

// After: Simple string approach for HTTP URLs
if (url.startsWith("http")) {
    setDataSource(url)
} else {
    setDataSource(context, Uri.parse(url))
}
```

### 2. Network Security Configuration
**File**: `AudiobookPlayer/app/src/main/res/xml/network_security_config.xml`

- Added explicit trust for Heroku domains
- Configured proper HTTPS certificate handling
- Maintained cleartext support for local development

### 3. Retry Logic with Fallback
**File**: `MediaPlaybackService.kt`

- Implemented retry mechanism (2 attempts for primary URL)
- Added fallback to direct R2 URLs if streaming proxy fails
- Removed auto-skip behavior that masked real errors

### 4. Backend Range Request Support
**File**: `main.py`

- Fixed HTTP range request parsing
- Added proper 206 Partial Content responses
- Improved error handling for range requests

### 5. Debug Tools
**Files**: 
- `AudiobookPlayer/app/src/main/java/com/audiobookplayer/activities/DebugActivity.kt`
- `AudiobookPlayer/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_debug.xml`

- Created debug activity to test URLs directly
- Added play/stop controls for testing
- Pre-filled with your working streaming URL
- Access via long-press on sync button in main activity

## Testing Your URL

Your streaming URL works perfectly in browsers:
```
https://epub-audiobook-service-ab00bb696e09.herokuapp.com/api/stream/1141127507/3da9b6f3-3eae-4a06-9687-9e7743817194/chapter_1.mp3
```

**Verified with curl**:
- ✅ Returns proper HTTP 200 response
- ✅ Content-Type: audio/mpeg
- ✅ Content-Length: 3,320,064 bytes (3.2MB)
- ✅ Accept-Ranges: bytes header present

## How to Test

1. **Build the app**:
   ```bash
   ./build_debug_apk.sh
   ```

2. **Install on device**:
   ```bash
   adb install AudiobookPlayer/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
   ```

3. **Test streaming URL**:
   - Open the app
   - Long-press the "Sync" button to open Debug Activity
   - The URL is pre-filled with your working streaming URL
   - Tap "Test URL" to test MediaPlayer preparation
   - Tap "Play" if preparation succeeds

4. **Test full audiobook playback**:
   - Enter user ID: `1141127507`
   - Tap "Sync Audiobooks"
   - Select an audiobook to play

## Expected Results

With these fixes, the Android MediaPlayer should now:
- ✅ Successfully prepare streaming URLs
- ✅ Handle network interruptions with retries
- ✅ Fall back to alternative URLs if needed
- ✅ Provide better error reporting instead of silent failures

## Additional Notes

- The debug activity helps isolate MediaPlayer issues from UI complexity
- Network security config ensures HTTPS works properly with Heroku
- Retry logic handles temporary network issues
- Backend improvements support better streaming compatibility

If issues persist, the debug activity will show exactly where the MediaPlayer fails, making it easier to identify remaining compatibility issues.
